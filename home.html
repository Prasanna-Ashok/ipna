                <p>IPNA was formed on Nov 18 th , 2018 and registered on Dec11th, 2019 with Registration .No:
                    SRG/Vellore/263/2019. IPNA was started with a call to serve the individual rights of its
                    members so that each one can effectively and efficiently function to fulfill the common goal to
                    improve perioperative patient safety. An association for perioperative nurses will enable them to
                    focus on educating, updating and continuing togetherness in improving perioperative patient
                    safety across the country. Improving patient safety is an increasing priority for the surgical team
                    and the hospitals since sentinel events can be catastrophic for patients, care givers as well as for
                    the institutions. The knowledge and skill to assist the perioperative patient in moving across the
                    perioperative continuum will enhance positive patient outcome. With health care system being
                    dyanamic and with the advent of technology in surgery, we (IPNA) must be proactive and patient
                    oriented.</p>

        <h3 class="about-heading">PREAMBLE</h3>
        <p>The perioperative setting in any medical center is the vital department for surgical intervention.
            It runs strong on collaborative care concept. Operating room (OR) nurses are the binding factor
            of the team. OR nurses deal with immediate pre-operative care, intraoperative care and
            immediate post-operative care; hence these nurses are identified as perioperative nurses. Patient
            safety in the perioperative settings is of primary concern. An association for perioperative nurses
            will enable them to focus on educating, updating and continuing togetherness in improving
            perioperative patient safety across the country. Improving patient safety is an increasing priority
            for the surgical team and the hospitals since sentinel events can be catastrophic for patients, care
            givers as well as for the institutions.</p>
